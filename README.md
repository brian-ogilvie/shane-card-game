A game designed by my four-year-old.

## How To Play

This is a two-player game. Your quest is to find the winning card, the one with the rainbow polka dots. **Beware:** ferocious drgagons lurk under the remaining nine cards! 

A random player is selected to begin the action. Each player selects one card to turn over, then play alternates until the rainbow card is located. 

Scores are infinite. Feel free to keep playing for hours! 

## Technology

This is good, old-fashioned HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It's refreshing to take a break from frameworks and npm packages every now and then!
